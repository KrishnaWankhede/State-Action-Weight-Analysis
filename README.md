# State-Action-Weight-Analysis

 # Overview

This project involves analyzing and computing weights associated with states, observations, and actions within a defined system or environment. The Python script processes multiple input files containing data about states, state weights, observations, actions, and their respective weights. This analysis aids in understanding the significance of each state and action within the system based on given observations.

# Input Files

The project utilizes five key input files:

states.txt: Lists all possible states within the system.

state_weights.txt: Contains weights assigned to each state, indicating their importance or value.

observation_actions.txt: Specifies observations and the corresponding actions to be taken.

state_observation_weights.txt: Provides weights for each state based on different observations.

state_action_state_weights.txt: Details the weights of transitioning from one state to another based on specific actions.

Each file follows a structured format to ensure accurate processing by the script.


# Script Functionality

The Python script hw33.py performs several functions:

Reads and parses the input files to understand the system's states, observations, actions, and their respective weights.

Computes and analyzes the impact of different actions based on the observations and the current state.

Determines the optimal actions and state transitions within the system based on the provided weights.

# Running the Script

To execute the script and perform the analysis, follow these steps:


Ensure all input files (states.txt, state_weights.txt, observation_actions.txt, state_observation_weights.txt, and state_action_state_weights.txt) are located in the same directory as the script.

Run the script using a Python interpreter. Example command:

Copy code

python hw33.py

The script will process the input files and output the analysis results to the console or to an output file, depending on the script's implementation.

# Requirements

Python 3.x: The script is written in Python and requires a Python 3.x interpreter to run.

# Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of states, observations, and actions within a specific system. By evaluating the weights associated with each element, the script aids in identifying the most valuable actions and state transitions based on the given data.
